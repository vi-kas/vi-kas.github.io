Moreover, telling people that I’m a vegetarian, clarifies that I don’t eat meat. This is just to identify myself, telling others of my choices.\nBut Identity, is much more powerful than this. The way we see ourselves, has a profound impact on how we deal with traction and distractions. Our perception about selves can largely impact our actions in future.\nChristopher Bryan, along with his fellow psychology researchers from Stanford designed a study around this thing called Identity. The study was performed to test how thinking about ourselves can affect our actions.\nHe performed this study among two groups of voters. They were given a task to complete questions related to an upcoming election. Questions asked to one group included a verb to vote, for example \u0026ldquo;How important is it for you to vote?\u0026rdquo;\nThe second group answered similar questions included the noun Voter, instead of the verb, like \u0026ldquo;How important is it for you to be a Voter?\u0026rdquo;\nThe researchers cross referenced voting records to confirm whether they have actually voted. The results showed that a minor difference in words proved to make a big difference. It showed that being a voter were much more likely to vote than those who were asked how likely they were to vote!\nGoing beyond to ensure the results were correct, researchers conducted another election to confirm the validity, but the results were the same. The Voter group dramatically outperformed the to vote group.\nThe results concluded that individuals are more likely to act when that act is represented as an expression of them, like their personal self, character or behavior, in other words their Identity.\nNir Eyal, in his book Indistractable writes, “Identity is another cognitive shortcut that helps our brain make otherwise difficult choices in advance, thereby streamlining decision making. Our perception of who we are changes what we do.”\nBy thinking of yourself as a person with identity, YOU empower yourself and YOU trigger your actions!\nYou can also use this Identity as a rationale to tell others why you do what you do!\nUse it wisely.\ncourtesy ~ Nir Eyal | From the Book InDistractable\n","date":1591352869,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591352869,"objectID":"d9431084106e020bf6bc9b6bbc93aa81","permalink":"/post/waiting-to-be-identified/","publishdate":"2020-06-05T18:27:49+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/waiting-to-be-identified/","section":"post","summary":"Identity is another cognitive shortcut that helps our brain make otherwise difficult choices in advance, thereby streamlining decision making.

No, but a note at the beginning, there’s going to be a lot of questions in this post. Let’s see if you enjoy it. What do you think? Do we need a definition of what a question is? Nah! We don’t need to have a number of certain words, if put together in a structured manner, making some meaning we already know, do we? Anyway, let me tell you there are two categories of questions.\n One that make sense  Okay, stop and guess which one is the second? Yeah, those which do not fall in the first category.\nSecond, which are not in first category.  And mark my words, I did not say, few questions do not make any sense. Don’t assume it. Don’t believe me? Wait! Take a look at this question:\nA. Rank the candidates in order of how bad they were in the interview. Worst takes precedence.\n___ David ___ Cristiano ___ Leonardo ___ Serena ___ Chuck Norris  Did you like the question? Is this a category one or a category two question? Well, I’ll leave that to you, comments are welcome. But, one thing for sure, the one who asked this question, seemed to me as going through something in life and this is not saying that candidates were not good. Or May be it’s a test for the interviewer, god knows. Let’s take a look at another question:\nB. Did you watch the movie, Dunkirk?\n___ Yes\n___ No\nNow, which category does this question falls into? May be the first one, if you’ve something with which you can follow up, then it makes sense to ask questions such as these, or else you know, if you don’t care about the answer, then it’s a sign that boss you’ve got problems! or you’re an introvert. Okay, my turn, one of my favorite questions.\nC. What is the meaning of life?\n ___ (Do we need this?)  These are called rhetorical questions. Okay, so did we just give a third classification? No, obviously not, this question does not make any sense, where’s the bucket for category two questions? Few more of these?\nD. Why me? (Asked under some serious circumstances)\nE. (Girl to her Boy) How much you love me? (ha ha ha)\nThis one definitely gives the boy some hard time. Well, questions are not always asked to make sense. A lot of times these are asked as answers to themselves. Of course, “Why me?” is of that sort. But why do we bother about them.\nRegardless of making sense, questions are there. If you have some, then ask. By the way, why did we choose this picture(Look atop) for our post?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no point asking that, is there?\n","date":1502535300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591354500,"objectID":"5630ce19b89335d3c63580095d10fc48","permalink":"/post/questions/","publishdate":"2017-08-12T18:55:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/questions/","section":"post","summary":"There's no point asking that, is there?","tags":["questions","behaviour","human"],"title":"Questions","type":"post"},{"authors":["Vikash Sharma"],"categories":["motivation"],"content":"A morning run gives a perfect start to your day. It keeps you healthy and active. People are enjoying the freshness it provides. But a majority of population are not able to get out of their beds to make it a habit.\nI woke up early on Monday, went out, on track, ran, it felt like just now I started living. But I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to continue next day. It happens, to a lot of them who give it a try. Getting out of bed, to run is easy to say but very hard when you have to. A morning run is a habit. But if you see it involves few more small but important habits. Your motive is single and simple, to feel active, that\u0026rsquo;s why you choose to run, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? But a run is not. It has a pattern.\nWhat is that?\nTo run you have to make a habit of waking up early, If you are able to do it a couple of days, it won\u0026rsquo;t take too long and you\u0026rsquo;ll find yourself on track. It\u0026rsquo;s simple first start waking up early, don\u0026rsquo;t push yourself too much, just wake up (Second habit is to get out of bed, if you think getting out of bed a bit different than waking up). Now you are on track, start walking for a couple of days. Let yourself feel easy, you seem to enjoy it, freshness. Believe me you\u0026rsquo;ll find yourself walking with ease in no time. And not too long from that day, you\u0026rsquo;ll start running. You can count running as your habit now, because it\u0026rsquo;s fulfilling your motive. You feel fresh, their was a day when you tried but failed, because it\u0026rsquo;s a habit, it takes time. So tried this pattern. A simpler but effective.\nWhy this worked?\nThis ain\u0026rsquo;t magic, what you did is nothing but what you wanted. The key is to understand what\u0026rsquo;s stopping us from our goal. May be there are more than one reasons. Break them, check them one by one. Soon you\u0026rsquo;ll see your problem as a small one. One great thing about it is, when you try simplifying this, chances are more of you being into it, I mean succeeding. Like each time you took one step, chances were more of your doing the next. Yeah, you got it.\nDoes it work in every aspect of life?\nYou want to work harder/smarter, get things done and smile, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Breaking and checking works in every aspect of life, ask yourself. Making a habit, breaking a habit(It\u0026rsquo;s a bad one!), Getting out of depression(might be a relationship or work pressure) for almost everything you can apply. I personally believe it\u0026rsquo;s a pattern, an effective one. So how you apply means a lot. Of course, habit of waking up is prior than, a walk. Simple get the idea, use your assets (Mind, I meant) and do it. I Hope, it\u0026rsquo;ll work out for you. Because a morning run gave us this lesson!\n","date":1451905061,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591354661,"objectID":"dc3922a63cadef0c564a9e4f82888ad4","permalink":"/post/what-a-morning-run-teaches-you/","publishdate":"2016-01-04T18:57:41+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/what-a-morning-run-teaches-you/","section":"post","summary":"Does it work in every aspect of life?","tags":["morning-run","motivation"],"title":"What a Morning Run Teaches You","type":"post"}]
