      <title>Waiting to Be Identified</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s an old joke – How do you know someone’s a Vegetarian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punch line to this is - Don’t worry, they will tell you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a vegetarian, I have lived this Joke. Moreover, telling people that I’m a vegetarian, clarifies that I don’t eat meat. This is just to identify myself, telling others of my choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Identity, is much more powerful than this. The way we see ourselves, has a profound impact on how we deal with traction and distractions. Our perception about selves can largely impact our actions in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Bryan, along with his fellow psychology researchers from Stanford designed a study around this thing called Identity. The study was performed to test how thinking about ourselves can affect our actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He performed this study among two groups of voters. They were given a task to complete questions related to an upcoming election. Questions asked to one group included a verb to vote, for example &amp;ldquo;How important is it for you to vote?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group answered similar questions included the noun Voter, instead of the verb, like &amp;ldquo;How important is it for you to be a Voter?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers cross referenced voting records to confirm whether they have actually voted. The results showed that a minor difference in words proved to make a big difference. It showed that being a voter were much more likely to vote than those who were asked how likely they were to vote!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going beyond to ensure the results were correct, researchers conducted another election to confirm the validity, but the results were the same. The Voter group dramatically outperformed the to vote group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results concluded that individuals are more likely to act when that act is represented as an expression of them, like their personal self, character or behavior, in other words their Identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nir Eyal, in his book Indistractable writes, “Identity is another cognitive shortcut that helps our brain make otherwise difficult choices in advance, thereby streamlining decision making. Our perception of who we are changes what we do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By thinking of yourself as a person with identity, YOU empower yourself and YOU trigger your actions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use this Identity as a rationale to tell others why you do what you do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Questions</title>
      <link>/post/questions/</link>

      <guid>/post/questions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you kidding me? No, but a note at the beginning, there’s going to be a lot of questions in this post. Let’s see if you enjoy it. What do you think? Do we need a definition of what a question is? Nah! We don’t need to have a number of certain words, if put together in a structured manner, making some meaning we already know, do we? Anyway, let me tell you there are two categories of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One that make sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, stop and guess which one is the second? Yeah, those which do not fall in the first category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, which are not in first category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And mark my words, I did not say, few questions do not make any sense. Don’t assume it. Don’t believe me? Wait! Take a look at this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. Rank the candidates in order of how bad they were in the interview. Worst takes precedence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;___ David

___ Cristiano

___ Leonardo

___ Serena

___ Chuck Norris
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you like the question? Is this a category one or a category two question? Well, I’ll leave that to you, comments are welcome. But, one thing for sure, the one who asked this question, seemed to me as going through something in life and this is not saying that candidates were not good. Or May be it’s a test for the interviewer, god knows. Let’s take a look at another question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. Did you watch the movie, Dunkirk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, which category does this question falls into? May be the first one, if you’ve something with which you can follow up, then it makes sense to ask questions such as these, or else you know, if you don’t care about the answer, then it’s a sign that boss you’ve got problems! or you’re an introvert. Okay, my turn, one of my favorite questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. What is the meaning of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  ___ (Do we need this?)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are called rhetorical questions. Okay, so did we just give a third classification? No, obviously not, this question does not make any sense, where’s the bucket for category two questions? Few more of these?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Why me? (Asked under some serious circumstances)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E. (Girl to her Boy) How much you love me? (ha ha ha)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one definitely gives the boy some hard time. Well, questions are not always asked to make sense. A lot of times these are asked as answers to themselves. Of course, “Why me?” is of that sort. But why do we bother about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of making sense, questions are there. If you have some, then ask. By the way, why did we choose this picture(Look atop) for our post?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no point asking that, is there?&lt;/p&gt;
