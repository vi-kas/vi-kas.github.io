      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you have a garden? Oh, you love watering the trees, great! If you have, maybe you have tried planting a seed. That’s fantastic, if not let’s try something, plant a seed, water it and go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good morning, it’s a new day, go check out the seed, has it grown? No? Ok, no worries, just water it, we’ll come back tomorrow. Do this for a couple of days, go and check each day, is it not growing as expected, you were only able to see tiny leaves, no flowers yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, stop it man! We know it takes time. It doesn’t grow this soon. It takes time, cause it’s natural. Oh, then it’s time for you to understand, that’s how we should treat ourselves. We are also not machines, we are a natural product (Yes, really). Whenever you start learning anything, you know that the first day is like planting a seed, then you can’t get away, you’ve to water it for its growth. At the same time, it’s important to keep your patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that it takes time. It’s really idiotic to expect some result every day, but it’s important to make an effort for the result. There are times, when we pressure ourselves so hard, we forget that it’s a natural phenomenon that whatever time we’re investing, is worth and of real importance for us to grow. Every tiny bit you’re learning every day is of so much importance. Results are like flowers (or fruits if you’d like) so you have to wait for them to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, said this, it’s obvious (you must) for you to know about the flowers. If you have no idea about why you’re planting the seed. Then even if it’s good to plant a seed, you may not be watering it and that’ll in effect destroy (don’t do) it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know your reasons, even if it’s based on future outcomes. Knowing them, will make you put your efforts every day. It’s called perseverance, quoting Wikipedia for it, your actions despite the difficulty or delay in achieving success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ve just got to know an already known fact about yourself (your actions).&lt;/p&gt;
