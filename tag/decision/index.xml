      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting and exciting topic for research- why people do what they do. Studying on why and how people make decisions. Decisions as minor as which toothpaste to buy or decide to have children when the costs, in terms of money and hard work, can not be compared with the affection and contentment they bring. So hard to calculate. Talking about the Costs, Here in India, It can be seen that people are ready to send their Kids to expensive private schools instead of free public ones! Why does money is not a matter of fact here in Decision making. How do people decide to marry a person whom they know for few minutes and deny to those whom They know for Years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of our important decisions are, in fact, attempts to forecast the future. When people send their children to private expensive schools, it is in part, a bet that money spend today on schooling will yield happiness and opportunities in the future. When people decide to have a baby, they are in a way forecasting that the joy of becoming a parent will outweigh the cost of sleepless and tiring nights with the baby. When people choose to get married- though it may seem totally unromantic - They are, at some level, forecasting that the benefits of settling down are greater than the opportunity of seeing who else will come along on their journey. So These are in a way Decision Making, then what&amp;rsquo;s Good Decision Making?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Decision making is subject to the basic ability to envision what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s amazing how people managed, in course of their daily life choose various futures, without getting affected by the complexities of each choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why some people are able to make better Choices then others? Are they more skilled than others at envisioning various futures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think it&amp;rsquo;s a skill, It&amp;rsquo;s good that you&amp;rsquo;re predicting. Let&amp;rsquo;s make your day by affirming your words. Yes it&amp;rsquo;s a skill. It&amp;rsquo;s a Skill, where people who make it their comfort zone to remain in Doubt. How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People by making decisions learn to live with doubt in their comfort zone.
It&amp;rsquo;s normal for people, to want to know how things will turn our. And it&amp;rsquo;s scary when we realize how much rides on choices where we can&amp;rsquo;t predict the future. Will the baby be born healthy or sick? Will my better half and I still love each other 5 years down the line? Does my kid will perform better if I invest more on him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forecasting is terrifying, science because it forces us to confront what we don&amp;rsquo;t know, even if we want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expects us to live in a doubtful world and make comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a successful decision is precisely, to choose and to believe that it all work out Great
It&amp;rsquo;s a skill requiring to develop a comfort with doubt. You have to learn and develop this skill. Most of the successful people, entrepreneurs have done it. When they started their company. They had a vision, we know it was in a doubtful world, but that world was their comfort zone. Apple started in a Garage. Mr Jobs never would have imagined. But had a vision. He might have some doubts but that never stopped him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a successful decision is precisely, to choose and to believe that it all work out Great, with this doubt that(Even if it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t, We&amp;rsquo;ll make it work Great!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do so, You&amp;rsquo;ll see yourself in your own Hall of Fame.&lt;/p&gt;
